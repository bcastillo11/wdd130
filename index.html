        <p>My name is Byron Castillo. I was born in Managua, Nicaragua, in 2001.
            My grandfather was one of the very first members of The Church of Jesus
            Christ of Latter-day Saints in my country, and he was very loyal to his
            faith—as is my father. Therefore, I grew up as a member of the Church and
            served a mission from 2020 to 2022. My faith in Jesus is the most important
            part of my life. Although that hasn't always been the case, it is something
            I have built through dedication.

            Dedication and commitment are key to succeeding in everything we do in life,
            and I am now doing my best to put all my dedication into becoming a great web
            developer

        <p>Texas is a very nice state. The weather is ruthless, but the people are friendly
            and nice. Even nowadays, you can see some people dressing like cowboys on the 
            streets, which is pretty awesome. People feels free to be themselves.Buc-ee's - 
            which is the name comapny's name of the logo on the right - is one of the most
            iconic pit stop places you can choose to stop at along your way. They have one 
            of the best brisket sandwiches — it's a must-try!</p>
